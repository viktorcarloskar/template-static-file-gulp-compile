title: Rethinking Spotify desktop
date: June 12, 2013
---
Me and some other interaction design students thought the Spotify desktop application needed some love. It had looked the same for some time, and Spotify also got a new graphic profile. So we decided to rethink how the Spotify desktop app could look like. We wanted to do this to challenge ourself and for us to have something fun and productive to do after school.

This was just a fun challenge we decided to test out and we just wanted to challenge ourself. But through connections some designers at Spotify really like the idea and decided to act as a jury for our competition and also sponsored us with some prices.

### Before
The old design (0.9.X) was too similar to iTunes; huge lists with a focus on fitting as much content into the window as possible. Most often I, the user, find what I’m looking for (if I’ve e.g. searched for a song) in the 10 results. I am also normally a big fan of dark UI’s, but I believe this one is too dark, and frankly, quite boring.
